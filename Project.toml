# There seems  to be  a problem with  dependency management  when taking
# package information form multiple registries,  so we use two different
# UUIDs  here.  The plan  is  to  switch  to  the "General"  UUID  after
# finalization of the initial development steps and to continue on General.

# UUID of V0.1.0 registered on General (and v >=0.2.0)
uuid = "955f2c64-5fd0-11e9-0ad0-3332e913311a"
