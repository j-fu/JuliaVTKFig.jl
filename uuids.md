# Remark on UUIDs

There seems to be a problem  with dependency management (or lacking of
understanding)   when  taking   package   information  from   multiple
registries, so we use two different UUIDs here.  The plan is to switch
to the  "General" UUID after  finalization of the  initial development
steps and to continue on General.

- UUID of V0.1.0 registered on General (and v >=0.2.0)
    `uuid = "955f2c64-5fd0-11e9-0ad0-3332e913311a"`

- UUID for development of v0.1.x on j-fu/PackageNursery
    `uuid = "63b67fce-66f7-11ea-1808-1361d8c55bf4"`
